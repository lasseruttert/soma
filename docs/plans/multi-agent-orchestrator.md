# Multi-Agent Orchestrator Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a multi-agent system using an orchestrator pattern with LangGraph. The system will transition from the current single-agent LangChain implementation to a sophisticated multi-agent architecture where specialized agents handle different types of tasks.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Orchestrator (LangGraph Router)**
   - LLM-based routing to determine which agent(s) to invoke
   - Maintains conversation context and memory
   - Aggregates results from multiple agents
   - Handles error propagation and fallback strategies

2. **Specialized Agents (5 Types)**
   - Research/Information Gathering Agent
   - Code Analysis/Development Agent
   - Data Processing Agent
   - Creative/Content Generation Agent
   - Task Planning/Coordination Agent

3. **State Management**
   - Conversation memory persistence
   - Context passing between orchestrator and agents
   - Result aggregation and formatting

## Technical Implementation

### LangGraph Integration

#### State Schema
```python
class OrchestratorState(TypedDict):
    user_query: str
    conversation_history: List[Dict]
    selected_agents: List[str]
    agent_results: Dict[str, Any]
    final_response: str
    context: Dict[str, Any]
```

#### Workflow Design
1. **Query Analysis Node**
   - Analyze user input using LLM
   - Determine appropriate agent(s) to invoke
   - Extract context and requirements

2. **Agent Routing Node**
   - Route to selected agent(s) based on analysis
   - Conditional branching to specialized agents
   - Parallel execution support for multi-agent tasks

3. **Agent Execution Nodes** (5 specialized nodes)
   - Individual execution environments for each agent type
   - Tool selection using decision tree logic
   - Result formatting and validation

4. **Result Aggregation Node**
   - Combine results from multiple agents
   - Resolve conflicts and inconsistencies
   - Format final response

5. **Memory Update Node**
   - Update conversation history
   - Store context for future interactions
   - Maintain user preferences and patterns

### Decision Tree Tool Selection

Each agent will implement intelligent tool selection using:
- **Primary Decision Factors:** Task type, data availability, user preferences
- **Secondary Factors:** Tool performance, resource constraints, fallback options
- **Learning Mechanism:** Track tool effectiveness for future decisions

### Memory Management

#### Conversation Memory
- **Short-term:** Current session context and state
- **Long-term:** User preferences, successful patterns, historical interactions
- **Contextual:** Task-specific information and intermediate results

#### Memory Persistence
- ChromaDB integration for long-term memory storage
- Session-based memory for current interactions
- User profile management for personalization

## Implementation Phases
